# hello-world
Just another repository.

I am an Electrical Engineering student at Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF) and I work as a tutor in a University Preparation Course. I am passionate for novel technologies focused in electronics and electrical engineering. Last but not least, programming is a subject that I am always refining, learning and practicing.
